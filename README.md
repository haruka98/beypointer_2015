# Beypointer

## What is this?
This program counts points in Beyblade fights. It was an old project of mine (2015) and one of the first programs i ever published.

## How to use?
The Beypointer is intended for use under windows. Execute the *beypointer.bat* in any folder. It will create one additional file called *Beypoints.txt* where it stores the current score.

## Where was this published?
This software was published on the website of the *World Beyblade Organisation* on the 20th of May 2015. You can visit the original post [here](https://worldbeyblade.org/Thread-Beypointer--70006).

## Is the software still being developed?
No, the program is "as is", which means that after the initial release in 2015, I didn't change anything. There are a few things I would do differently now, but since this is a legacy project, I keep it the way it is.
